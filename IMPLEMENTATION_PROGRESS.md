## Architecture Decisions

### Repository Pattern
- Abstract interfaces for testability
- Concrete implementations for flexibility
- In-memory caching for performance
- Local storage for offline support

### State Management
- Riverpod for dependency injection
- FutureProvider for async operations
- StreamProvider for real-time data
- StateNotifier for complex state

### Data Flow
```
UI Layer (Widgets)
    â†“
Provider Layer (Riverpod)
    â†“
Repository Layer (Interfaces)
    â†“
Service Layer (Implementation)
    â†“
Data Sources (API, Local Storage, Firebase)
```

### Real-time Strategy
- Firebase Realtime Database for primary real-time sync
- WebSocket for secondary updates and notifications
- Stream-based architecture for reactive UI

### Offline Strategy
- Hive for local persistence
- Sync queue for offline operations
- Automatic background sync when online
- Conflict resolution strategies

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Authentication System** (High Priority)
   - Firebase Auth integration
   - Biometric authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Session management

2. **Implement Remaining Repositories** (High Priority)
   - Agency repository implementation
   - Fund repository implementation
   - Citizen repository implementation

3. **Create Providers for All Entities** (High Priority)
   - Agency providers
   - Fund providers
   - Citizen providers
   - Alert providers

4. **Update UI to Use Providers** (High Priority)
   - Refactor dashboard to use projectStatsProvider
   - Add pull-to-refresh
   - Add error handling
   - Add loading states

5. **Begin Feature Implementation** (Medium Priority)
   - Citizen portal
   - Document management
   - Advanced reporting

## Technical Debt

- [ ] Implement full JSON serialization for local storage
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Add logging framework
- [ ] Generate Hive adapters
- [ ] Add API integration layer
- [ ] Implement proper Firebase configuration
- [ ] Add environment configuration (dev/staging/prod)

## Performance Metrics Goals

- App startup time: < 2 seconds
- Page transition: < 300ms
- API response handling: < 1 second
- Offline mode switching: Instant
- Real-time update latency: < 500ms
- Map rendering: < 2 seconds

## Security Checklist

- [ ] API keys encrypted
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- [ ] HTTPS only for API calls
- [ ] Input validation on all forms
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] XSS prevention
- [ ] CSRF token implementation
- [ ] Rate limiting on API calls
- [ ] Biometric authentication
- [ ] Session timeout implementation

## Dependencies Status

All major dependencies already added to pubspec.yaml:
- âœ… Riverpod for state management
- âœ… Firebase suite (Auth, Database, Messaging, Analytics, Crashlytics)
- âœ… Hive for local storage
- âœ… Dio for networking
- âœ… Socket.io for WebSocket
- âœ… Charts libraries (fl_chart, syncfusion)
- âœ… Maps (flutter_map, google_maps_flutter)
- âœ… Utilities (intl, uuid, encrypt)

## Notes

- Using demo data initially; will migrate to real API
- Firebase configuration pending (requires google-services.json)
- Blockchain integration deferred to later phase
- Focus on core functionality before advanced features
