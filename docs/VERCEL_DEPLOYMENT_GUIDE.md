# Vercel Deployment Guide for PM-AJAY Flutter Web App

## Prerequisites

1. **Flutter SDK** installed (3.0.0 or higher)
2. **Vercel CLI** installed: `npm install -g vercel`
3. **Git** repository initialized
4. **Vercel account** created at https://vercel.com

## Step 1: Build Flutter Web App

```bash
# Clean previous builds
flutter clean

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Build for web with release mode
flutter build web --release --dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=production
```

This creates optimized production build in `build/web/` directory.

## Step 2: Configure Vercel

The [`vercel.json`](../vercel.json) file is already configured with:
- Static file serving from `build/web/`
- Single Page Application routing
- Production environment variables

## Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

### Option A: Deploy via Vercel CLI

```bash
# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy (first time)
vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

### Option B: Deploy via Git Integration

1. **Push code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy PM-AJAY to Vercel"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect Repository to Vercel**
   - Go to https://vercel.com/new
   - Import your Git repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect Flutter web project

3. **Configure Build Settings**
   - Framework Preset: `Other`
   - Build Command: `flutter build web --release`
   - Output Directory: `build/web`
   - Install Command: `flutter pub get`

4. **Add Environment Variables** (in Vercel Dashboard)
   ```
   ENVIRONMENT=production
   API_KEY=your_api_key
   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=pm-ajay-prod
   ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_encryption_key
   ```

5. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Vercel will build and deploy automatically

## Step 4: Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to your project settings in Vercel
2. Navigate to "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain: `pm-ajay.gov.in`
4. Configure DNS records as instructed by Vercel

## Step 5: Continuous Deployment

Once connected to Git:
- **Automatic deployments** on every push to main branch
- **Preview deployments** for pull requests
- **Instant rollbacks** if needed

## Build Optimization

### Enable Web Renderers

For better performance, specify the renderer:

```bash
# HTML renderer (smaller bundle, better for simple apps)
flutter build web --web-renderer html

# CanvasKit renderer (better performance for complex graphics)
flutter build web --web-renderer canvaskit

# Auto (default, chooses based on device)
flutter build web --web-renderer auto
```

### Code Splitting

The app uses lazy loading for better performance. See [`route_lazy_loading_config.dart`](../lib/core/config/route_lazy_loading_config.dart).

### PWA Support

Enable Progressive Web App features:

```bash
flutter build web --pwa-strategy=offline-first
```

## Monitoring

### Analytics

Analytics are automatically enabled in production via [`analytics_service.dart`](../lib/core/services/analytics_service.dart).

### Crash Reporting

Crash reporting is enabled via [`crash_reporting_service.dart`](../lib/core/services/crash_reporting_service.dart).

### Vercel Analytics

Enable in Vercel Dashboard:
1. Go to your project
2. Navigate to "Analytics"
3. Enable Vercel Analytics

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

```bash
# Clear Flutter cache
flutter clean
rm -rf build/

# Rebuild
flutter pub get
flutter build web --release
```

### Assets Not Loading

Ensure `pubspec.yaml` has correct asset paths:
```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/icons/
```

### CORS Issues

Configure CORS in your backend API or add Vercel headers in [`vercel.json`](../vercel.json):

```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/api/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        { "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "value": "*" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Firebase Not Working

1. Update Firebase config in [`firebase_options.dart`](../lib/firebase_options.dart)
2. Enable Firebase Hosting if needed
3. Configure authorized domains in Firebase Console

## Environment-Specific Builds

### Development
```bash
flutter build web --dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=development
```

### Staging
```bash
flutter build web --dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=staging
```

### Production
```bash
flutter build web --dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=production
```

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Enable Tree Shaking
Already enabled in release builds.

### 2. Compress Assets
```bash
# Install optimizer
flutter pub add flutter_native_splash

# Optimize images
flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
```

### 3. Minify JavaScript
Automatically done in release builds.

### 4. Use CDN
Vercel provides global CDN automatically.

## Security

### Environment Variables
Never commit sensitive data. Use Vercel environment variables:
- API keys
- Database credentials
- Encryption keys
- Third-party service tokens

### HTTPS
Vercel provides automatic HTTPS for all deployments.

### Security Headers
Add to [`vercel.json`](../vercel.json):
```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        { "key": "X-Content-Type-Options", "value": "nosniff" },
        { "key": "X-Frame-Options", "value": "DENY" },
        { "key": "X-XSS-Protection", "value": "1; mode=block" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Rollback

If deployment has issues:

```bash
# Via CLI
vercel rollback

# Via Dashboard
# Go to Deployments â†’ Click previous deployment â†’ "Promote to Production"
```

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Vercel

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          flutter-version: '3.24.0'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: flutter pub get
      
      - name: Build web
        run: flutter build web --release --dart-define=ENVIRONMENT=production
      
      - name: Deploy to Vercel
        uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v20
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
```

## Monitoring Deployments

### Vercel Dashboard
- Real-time build logs
- Deployment status
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking

### Custom Monitoring
Use built-in services:
- [`analytics_service.dart`](../lib/core/services/analytics_service.dart)
- [`crash_reporting_service.dart`](../lib/core/services/crash_reporting_service.dart)
- [`performance_service.dart`](../lib/core/services/performance_service.dart)

## Support

For issues:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Review Flutter web build output
3. Test locally: `flutter run -d chrome --release`
4. Check Vercel documentation: https://vercel.com/docs
