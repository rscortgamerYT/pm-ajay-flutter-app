## 2. VISUAL DESIGN SYSTEM

### 2.1 Government of India Branding
**Color Palette:**
```dart
class AppTheme {
  // Primary Colors - Government Identity
  static const governmentNavy = Color(0xFF000080);      // Official navy blue
  static const governmentSaffron = Color(0xFFFF9933);   // India flag saffron
  static const governmentGreen = Color(0xFF138808);     // India flag green
  
  // Semantic Colors
  static const successColor = Color(0xFF4CAF50);
  static const warningColor = Color(0xFFFF9800);
  static const errorColor = Color(0xFFF44336);
  static const infoColor = Color(0xFF2196F3);
  
  // Neutral Colors
  static const backgroundLight = Color(0xFFF5F5F5);
  static const surfaceWhite = Color(0xFFFFFFFF);
  static const textPrimary = Color(0xFF212121);
  static const textSecondary = Color(0xFF757575);
}
```

### 2.2 Typography Hierarchy
**Professional Font System:**
```dart
TextTheme(
  displayLarge: TextStyle(
    fontSize: 28,           // Major page headers
    fontWeight: FontWeight.w600,
    fontFamily: 'Noto Sans',
  ),
  displayMedium: TextStyle(
    fontSize: 24,           // Section headers
    fontWeight: FontWeight.w600,
    fontFamily: 'Noto Sans',
  ),
  headlineSmall: TextStyle(
    fontSize: 20,           // Card headers
    fontWeight: FontWeight.w500,
    fontFamily: 'Noto Sans',
  ),
  titleLarge: TextStyle(
    fontSize: 18,           // List item titles
    fontWeight: FontWeight.w500,
    fontFamily: 'Noto Sans',
  ),
  bodyLarge: TextStyle(
    fontSize: 16,           // Primary body text
    fontWeight: FontWeight.w400,
    fontFamily: 'Noto Sans',
  ),
  bodyMedium: TextStyle(
    fontSize: 14,           // Secondary body text
    fontWeight: FontWeight.w400,
    fontFamily: 'Noto Sans',
  ),
  labelLarge: TextStyle(
    fontSize: 16,           // Button text
    fontWeight: FontWeight.w500,
    fontFamily: 'Noto Sans',
  ),
)
```

**Rationale:**
- Noto Sans provides excellent readability and multilingual support
- Increased base font sizes improve readability without sacrificing professionalism
- Clear hierarchy helps officials scan information quickly
- Professional weight distribution maintains authority

### 2.3 Button Standards
**Minimum Height:** 56px for all interactive elements

### 6.2 Status Indicators
**Consistent Status System:**
```dart
enum ProjectStatus {
  notStarted,    // Gray - Planning phase
  inProgress,    // Blue - Active work
  onHold,        // Orange - Temporarily paused
  completed,     // Green - Successfully finished
  delayed,       // Red - Behind schedule
  cancelled,     // Red strikethrough - Terminated
}
```

**Visual Treatment:**
- Icon + Color + Text label for redundancy
- Consistent icons across the platform

- Minimum contrast ratio 3:1 for large text and UI components
- All functionality keyboard accessible
- Focus indicators clearly visible
- Screen reader support for all interactive elements

### 7.2 Responsive Design
**Supported Breakpoints:**
- Mobile: 320px - 767px (primary target)
- Tablet: 768px - 1023px
- Desktop: 1024px+ (web version)

**Considerations:**
- Touch-friendly targets on mobile
- Optimized layouts for each breakpoint
- Consistent functionality across devices

---

## 8. LANGUAGE SUPPORT

### 8.1 Multilingual Implementation
**Supported Languages:**
- English (default)

### Key Corrections Made
1. Removed recommendations for oversimplified UI
2. Eliminated bilingual label requirements
3. Restored professional dashboard complexity
4. Removed suggestions for large, simplified action cards
5. Maintained comprehensive feature set for trained users
6. Updated language support to single-language interface
7. Revised success metrics for professional users
8. Corrected testing protocol to focus on government officials

### Design Philosophy Shift
**From:** "Simplicity over complexity" for low-literacy users  
**To:** "Professional consistency and efficiency" for trained officials

This corrected approach ensures government officials have the professional tools they need to efficiently manage PM-AJAY programs.
